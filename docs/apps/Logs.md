The Log Listing Page provides a centralized interface for viewing and managing all logs within a specific App. This page displays all logs without categorization. The following technical flow outlines how this is accomplished:

## Fetching Logs

1. **API Call for Logs**:

   - An API call is made to the `getAppLog` function in the `DataSyncService` class.
   - This function retrieves all logs associated with the specific App.

2. **Displaying Logs**:
   - Once the logs are received, they are displayed using a jQuery DataTable.
   - The table presents all logs in a unified list, without categorization.

## Log Actions

1. **Viewing Log Details**:

   - Users can click on individual log entries to view detailed information.
   - This may include conversation history, context, and other relevant properties.

2. **Deleting Logs**:
   - Admin users have the capability to delete individual log entries if necessary.

## Data Storage

- Logs are stored in MongoDB, which allows for efficient querying and management of log data.
- The use of MongoDB enables scalable storage and quick retrieval of log information.

## User Interface

- The Log Listing Page presents a clean, unified view of all logs.
- Users can search, sort, and filter logs directly within the DataTable for easy navigation.

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination is implemented to manage large volumes of log data efficiently.
- Asynchronous loading might be used to improve page load times when dealing with extensive log histories.

This streamlined approach provides users with a comprehensive view of all app logs in a single, easy-to-navigate interface.
