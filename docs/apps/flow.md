# Overview

The NewRA Native App offers a platform for the development of both Custom Knowledge Bases and straightforward AI Based Model provider applications.

When building an app, you can select the type of application:

- Base Models: Uses base models such as OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and more as an information source.
- Knowledge Base: Uses a knowledge base as an information source.

You also have the flexibility to configure custom OpenAI parameters to boost the accuracy of responses. Furthermore, GPT and custom prompt settings supersede the GPT settings of the selected knowledge base.

Prompt engineering allows you to construct a custom prompt by organizing a dynamic form for tailored input. This input becomes the basis for initiating chats or conversations, personalized to the precise information given by end-users.

Currently, multiple providers are available, including:

- OpenAI (Gpt4, gpt40)
- Gemini (gemini)
- Anthropic (haiku)
- Mistral (mistral)

You can choose any of these providers.

Once you established the configurations, you can publish the app from the top bar and share it through multiple channels, including:

- Chat widget
- iFrame
- Public URL
- API
- Third-party integrations
