Each app can be shared or published based on the limitations defined in the user's subscription plan, specifically the number of apps they can create.

## Publishing an App

Before sharing, the app must be published. Once published, it can be utilized in the following four ways:

### Methods of Sharing

1. **Public URL** Share a direct link to the app via a public URL, allowing users to access it from any web browser.

2. **Chat Widget** Embed a chat widget on a website or web application to provide an interactive chat interface powered by the app.

3. **iFrame** Use an iFrame to embed the app within another web page, enabling seamless integration with existing web content.

4. **Chat API** Integrate with the Chat API to programmatically interact with the app, allowing for advanced customizations and automations. API Key can be generated and copied from this popup.

By understanding and utilizing these methods, you can efficiently share and deploy your apps according to your needs and the constraints of your subscription plan.
